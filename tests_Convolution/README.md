# Convolution Tests

The basic convolution algorithms in C were initially designed and tested in the first chip design. Due to the 32bit datatype limitation, uint32 datatype has been used in the test cases.

The basic algorithms were further enhanced and increased based on for-loop mechanisms and larger input matrix datasets, so that the tests would behave like convolution and convolution neural networks (CNN).

The algorithm logic is checked in the tests 1DConvo, LinearShift, testBasic1D and testBasic2D.

Larger datasets and multiple layer networks tests are in 2DCNNLayer1 and 2DCNNLayer2.
